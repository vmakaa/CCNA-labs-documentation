##VLAN summary
VLANs help switches adhere to subnets by seperating end-hosts on the same switch into different broadcast domains

Why VLANs? - network performance and security are the two big reasons

VLANs are switches only

##VLAN CLI
-show vlan brief = shows the VLANs that exist on the switch and which interfaces are in each VLAN

To create a VLAN on a switch:
-you either use a range of interfaces or a single interface
-you use the command "switchport mode access" ; this command sets those interfaces as access ports
  -access ports belong to a single VLAN
-and then the command "switchport access vlan <number>" ; this is the command that actually assigns the vlan to the port(s)
  -if vlan <number> doesnt already exist the switch automatically creates it

To manually create a VLAN:
-enter config mode and then type "vlan <number>" and it will create it for you

To name a VLAN:
-enter config mode
-type in "vlan <number>"
-type "name <name>"
