##Objectives
1. PC1 pings PC4.  
Identify the src/dst MAC address at each specified point in the route to PC4.
Identify the MAC address by the device and interface (ie. the MAC of R1 G0/0)
A. Source/Destination MAC at PC1 → SW1 segment
B. Source/Destination MAC at SW1 → R1 segment
C. Source/Destination MAC at R1 → R2 segment
D. Source/Destination MAC at R2 → R3 segment
E. Source/Destination MAC at R3 → SW2 segment
F. Source/Destination MAC at SW2 → PC4 segment

Use the CLI and Packet Tracer's simulation mode to verify your answers.
(Before you enter simulation mode, ping once to complete ARP/the MAC learning process.)

2. PC1 pings PC3.
Identify the src/dst MAC address at each specified point in the route to PC3.
Identify the MAC address by the device and interface (ie. the MAC of R1 G0/0)
A. Source/Destination MAC at PC1 → SW1
B. Source/Destination MAC at SW1 → PC3

Use the CLI and Packet Tracer's simulation mode to verify your answers.
(Before you enter simulation mode, ping once to complete ARP/the MAC learning process.)

3. PC4 pings PC1.
Identify the src/dst MAC address at each specified point in the route to PC1.
Identify the MAC address by the device and interface (ie. the MAC of R1 G0/0).

##Topology
in topology file

##Lab Setup
Packet Tracer

##Tasks Performed
In order to complete this lab, I analyzed the topology and determined the src and dst mac addresses and used the simulation mode in
packet tracer to verify my answers

Note:switches dont alter the src and dst mac addresses

1A. Src: MAc at PC1 Dst: Mac of R1 at int g0/0   
1B. Src: MAc at PC1 Dst: Mac of R1 at int g0/0
1C. Src: MAC of R1 at int g0/1 Dst: MAC of R2 and int g0/0
1D. Src: MAC of R2 at int g0/1 Dst: MAC of R3 at g0/0
1E. Src: MAC of R3 at g0/1 Dst: PC4
1F. Src: MAC of R3 at g0/1 Dst: PC4

Checking using simulation mode in packet tracer
1A is correct
1B is correct
1C is correct
1D is correct
1E is correct
1F is correct

2A. Src: MAC of PC1 Dst: MAC of PC3
2B. Src: MAC of PC1 Dst: MAC of PC3

2A and 2B are both correct

3 is just the reverse of 1
so you go from bottom to top in the way i ordered it in number 1
and then for each you switch src and dst
