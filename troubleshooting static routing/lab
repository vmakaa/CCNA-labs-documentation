##Objectives
PC1 and PC2 are unable to ping eachother.

There is one misconfiguration on each router.

Find and fix the misconfigurations.

You have successfully completed the lab when PC1 and PC2 can ping eachother.

##Topology
in topology folder

##Lab Setup
Packet Tracer

##Tasks performed
(R1) I checked the routing table and noticed that the static route for R1 to get to R2 is incorrect
in order to remove the incorrect version I used the following commands:
  show running-config | include ip route
  then i coped the configuration command
  and pasted it with no in front of it
(R2) I checked the routing table and realized that one of the interface exits used was incorrect so i opted to replace it for a next hop by removing the interface exit and addign a next hop
(R3) One of the router's interfaces had the wrong ip address so i used the no command on the incorrect one and I fixed it with the correct ip address. I also noticed that
it didnt have a static route so I added one using ip route ip address, subnet mask, and next hop.

Finally I pinged PC2 from PC1 to verify I had fixed all the misconfigurations and the two pcs were able to communicate verifying that I had completed the task at hand.
