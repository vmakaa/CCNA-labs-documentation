#Objectives
All devices are preconfigured from the end of Day 17's lab (SW2 has been replaced with a multilayer switch):
Hosts are in the correct VLANs.
SW1-SW2 are connected via trunk.
R1-SW2 are connected via ROAS.

1. Replace the ROAS configuration on R1-SW2 with a point-to-point Layer 3 connection.
    Use the IP addresses given in the network diagram.
    Configure a default route on SW2, with R1's G0/0 interface as the next hop.

2. Configure SVIs on SW2, one for each VLAN.
     Assign the last usable IP address of each subnet to the appropriate SVI.

3. Test inter-VLAN connectivity by pinging between VLANs.

4. Test connectivity to the Internet by pinging 1.1.1.1
    (Routes have already been configured on R1 and the Internet router)

#Lab Setup
Packet Tracer

#Tasks Performed
1. For the first task, I deleted g0/0.10, g0/0.20, & g0/0.30. Then I set g0/0 on the router to its default settings using "default interface g0/0." Then I assigned the router the ip address and subnet mask
of 10.0.0.194 255.255.255.252. I then configured SW2's G1/0/2 port for routing by using the commands "ip routing" (enables layer 3 routing" and "no switchport" (switches the port from a layer 2 accessport to
a layer 3 'routed port'). Finally I assigned the interface for SW2 the last usable IP address of 10.0.0.193 255.255.255.252. I finally set up the default route between SW2 and R1 by using the command
"ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.194" and set all the PCs default gateway address to SW2.

2. For this task, I configure an SVI for each VLAN. To do this, for each VLAN, I input the commands (example VLAN10) "interface vlan10", "ip address <last usable ip address of vlan10's subnet>", & finally
"no shutdown."

3. Connectivity confirmed.

4. Connectivity to the internet confirmed.
