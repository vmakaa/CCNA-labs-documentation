##Objectives
All devices have NO pre-configurations:

1. Configure the PCs and routers according to the network diagram (hostnames, IP addresses, etc.)
    Remember to configure the gateway on the PCs.
    (You don't have to configure the switches)

2. Configure static routes on the routers to enable PC1 to successfully ping PC2.

##Topology
in topology file

##Lab Setup
Packet Tracer

##Tasks Performed
(1) First I respectively set the ip addresses for PC1 and PC2 by going into their configs and accessing the interfaces connected to the switch.
Then i set the hostnames for the routers to R1, R2, and R3 respectively by going into global config mode and using the command:
    Router(global-config)#hostname R1

Then I set the ip addresses on each of the routers interface's by entering global config interface mode and setting the ip address,
adding a description, and using the no shutdown command. I then checked if my configurations work using do sh ip int br which verified
that my configurations did work

Then I set the gateway for PC1 and PC2 by going into the settings of PC 1 and 2 and typing in the router's ip address
    NOTE: Remember that the gateway is essentially the PC asking "Where do I send my traffic if I want to send traffic outside my LAN?"
and the answer would be the router in the PC's LAN

(2) To help with task 2 I am going to create a chart that will let me visualize the next hops needed
        ip destination       next hop
R1    192.168.3.0/24      192.168.12.2/24     
R2    192.168.1.0/24      192.168.12.1/24  
R2    192.168.3.0/24      192.168.13.3/24
R3    192.168.1.0/24      192.168.13.2/24




##Troubleshooting
I noticed one of the interfaces was down marked by the red triangle and I realized I had forgot to set up the ip address and do no shutdown
on one of the interfaces
