##Objectives
All devices have NO pre-configurations:

1. Configure the PCs and routers according to the network diagram (hostnames, IP addresses, etc.)
    Remember to configure the gateway on the PCs.
    (You don't have to configure the switches)

2. Configure static routes on the routers to enable PC1 to successfully ping PC2.
