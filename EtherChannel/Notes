>What is EtherChannel?
*EtherChannel is a way to add redundancy to a network topology
*An EtherChannel can group multiple physical links into one logical link
  *STP will also treat this group as a single interface (which means the extra ports wont be disabled)
*EtherChannnel Alternate names include:
  *Port Channel
  *LAG (Link Aggregation Group)

>How does EtherChannel Load Balance?
*Based on flows
  *A "flow" is a communication between two nodes in the network
  *Frames in the same flow will be forwarded using the same physical interface
    *If frames in the same flow were forwarded using different physical interfaces, some frames may arrive at the destination out of order which
could cause problems.
*Command to see curretn etherchannel load balance is "show etherchannel load-balance"
*Command to change load-balance method is "port channel load-balance [method]"
  *"port channel load-balance ?" to see different [methods]

>EtherChannel Configuration
*Three methods of etherchannle configuration on cisco switches:
      *PAgP (Port Aggregation Protocol)
        *Cisco protocol (only cisco switches)
        *Dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of the EtherChannel (Like DTP does for trunks). 
      *LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)
        *Industry Standard Protocol (IEE 801.23ad)
          *Dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of the EtherChannel (Like DTP does for trunks). 
          *Preferred EtherChannel method as it is universal
      *Static EtherChannel
        *A protocol isnt used to determine if an EtherChannel should be formed.
        *Interfaces are statically configured to form an EtherChannel.
*Up to 8 interfaces can be formed into a single EtherChannel
    *LACP allows up to 16, but only 8 will be active, the other 8 will be in standby mode, waiting for an active interface to fail.
*Select interfaces, uses command "channel-group [number] mode [mode]" 
*Physical interfaces must have matching configurations including: same duplex, same speed, same switchportmode (trunk/access), if it is a trunkport it needs the 
same allowed VLANS
  *If an interface's configs do not match the others. it will be excluded from the EtherChannel
  *"show etherchannel summary" to check

>Layer 3 EtherChannel
*Before continuing as normal for configuring EtherChannel after you select the interfaces you must use the command "no switchport" to enable
layer 3 switches
