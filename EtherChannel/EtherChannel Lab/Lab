##Objectives
*End host and SVI IP addresses are pre-configured*

1. Configure Layer 2 EtherChannel between ASW1 and DSW1 using LACP.
    Configure it as a trunk.

2. Configure Layer 2 EtherChannel between ASW2 and DSW2 using PAgP.
    Configure it as a trunk.

3. Configure Layer 3 EtherChannel between DSW1 and DSW2 using static EtherChannel.

4. Configure routes to allow the PCs to reach SRV1.

5. What is the default EtherChannel load-balancing method used on each switch?

6. Configure the switches to load-balance based on source and destination IP addresses.

##Lab Setup
Packet Tracer

##Tasks Performed
1. For ASW1 I did "interface range G0/1-2," then "channel-group 1 mode desir," then "switchport mode trunk." For DSW1 I did "interface range G1/0/3-4," "channel-group 1 mode desir," "switchport mode trunk."
2. For ASW1 I did "interface range G0/1-2," then "channel-group 1 mode active," then "switchport mode trunk." For DSW1 I did "interface range G1/0/3-4," "channel-group 1 mode active," "switchport mode trunk."
3. For the static EtherChannel connection between DSW1 I did "int range G1/0/1-2," "no switchport," "channel-group 3 mode on." For DSW2 I did "int range G1/0/1-2," "no switchport," "channel-group 3 mode on." 
  *For both I added the respective IP addresses for the L3 switches
4. On DSW1 and 2 I did "ip routing" to activate routing on layer 3 switches then on DSW1 I did "172.16.2.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2" then on DSW2 I did "172.16.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1"
4. For ASW1/2 and DSW 1/2 I did "do show etherchannel load-balance" both are src-mac
5. Each switch I did "port-channel load-balance src-dst-ip"
