#Objectives
1. Which switch is the root bridge?
    Use the CLI to examine the port role/state of each interface on the root.
    What appears different than what you have learned about the root bridge?
    What is the cause of this?

2. Without using the CLI, determine the port role/state of each remaining switch interface.
    Use the CLI to confirm.

3. Manually configure the appropriate RSTP link type on each interface.
    What do you think is the correct link type for SW1's F0/24?

#Lab Setup
Packet Tracer

#Tasks Performed
1. SW1 is the root bridge. Root bridges are supposed to have all their ports be forwarding, but there is one backup port. This is becuase two interfaces are connected to a hub, and there is a rule that there can only be one designated port in a 
collision domain.

2. Skip, Jeremy mentions that there is a error in the lab becuases of the hubs that causes the port statuses to switch. If you want practice determine the root port of each switch.

3. For SW3, F0/24 was an edge port which was configured via the command "span portfast." F0/1 is a ptp connection so it is configured using the command "span link point" and then F0/2 is con nected to a hub so the command is "span link shared"
For SW2, F0/1-2 and G0/1 were p2p and f0/23-24 were portf
For SW4, F0/1-2 were p2p and f0/24 was portf
For SW1, F0/2-3 were shared and F0/1 was a p2p and I think f0/24 is a shared port as well as an edge port, the spanning tree acts as if the hub isnt there and is connected directly to the PCs.
