##Objectives 
Subnet the 192.168.5.0/24 network to provide sufficient addressing for each LAN.
(Also, the point-to-point connection between R1 and R2).

Assign the first usable address to the PC in each LAN.

Assign the last usable address to the router's interface in each LAN.

Configure static routes on each router so that all PCs can ping eachother.

##Topology

##Lab Setup
Packet Tracer

##Tasks Performed
LAN 2 needs to be assigned a subnet first since it requires the most users
-hosts needed = 64
-so we need to borrow 1 bit
  -if we borrowed two only 62 usable addresses
-prefix length = /25; 126 usable addresses
-192.168.5.0 - 192.168.5.127
  -network address - 192.168.5.0
  -broadcast address - 192.168.5.127
  -PC in LAN 2 IP address = 192.168.15.1
  -Router for LAN 2 IP address = 192.168.5.126 subnet = 255.255.255.128

LAN 1 is next becuase it has the most users after LAN 2
-hosts needed = 45
-so we need to borrow two bits
  -64 total addresses, 62 usable addresses
-prefix length = /26
-192.168.5.128 - 192.168.5.191
  -network address = 192.168.5.128
  -broadcast address = 192.168.5.191
  -PC in LAN 1 IP address = 192.168.5.129
  -Router in LAN 1 IP address = 192.168.5.190 subnet = 255.255.255.192

Next is LAN 3 which has 14 hosts
-we need to borrow 4 bits
-prefix length = /28
-192.168.5.192 - 192.168.5.207
-subnet = 255.255.255.240
  -192.168.5.192 - 192.168.5.207
  -network address = 192.168.5.192
  -broadcast address = 192.168.5.207
  -PC in LAN 3 IP address = 192.168.5.193
  -LAN 3 interface to router IP address = 192.168.5.206


Next is LAN 4 which needs 9 hosts
- we need to borrow 4 bits 
-prefix length = /28
-usable addresses = 14, total addresses = 16
-subnet = 255.255.255.240
  -192.168.5.208 - 192.168.5.223
  -network address = 192.168.5.208
  -broadcast address = 192.168.5.223
  -PC in LAN 4 IP address = 192.168.5.209
  -LAN 4 interface to router IP address = 192.168.5.222


Lastly is the point to point connection
-we will want to use a /30
-4 total addresses, 2 usable addresses
  -192.168.5.224 - 192.168.5.227
  -netwrok address = 192.168.5.224
  -broadcast address = 192.168.5.227
  -point 1 IP address = 192.168.5.225
  -point 2 connection = 192.168.5.226
  -subnet = 255.255.255.252


Dont forget no shutdown on each of the interfaces!

Finally lets set up the static routes so the routers may communicate with each other
