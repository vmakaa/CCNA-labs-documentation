##Router
>Router info from day 11 part 1: Routers neve flood packets like switches if they dont know where the packet goes, if a route is not in a router's routing table the router
will drop the packet
*show ip route 
  -used to show a router's routing table
  -L for local means the routes to actual ip address configured on router's interface (the .1s, .2s, etc) (/32 netmask)
  -C for connected means the routes for the network the interface is connected to (the .0/24s etc.) (has a /24 netmask)
    -ex. the connected route for 192.168.12.40/24 is 192.168.12.0/24 and the local route is 192.168.12.40/32 (/32 just means all bits are fixed)
*no shutdown
  -all of a router's interfaces are administrativly down (shutdown) as a default setting. In order to opne these interfaces for use you must set the ip address then
use the no shutdown command
  -upon using the no shutdown command to routes are automatically added to the routing table, a Connected route and a Local route



##Router and Switch
*show ip interface brief
  -used to show a summary of the interfaces and their associated ip addresses as well as status (L1) and protocol (L2)
*ip address xx.xxx.xx.x.x 0-255.0-255.0-255.0-255
  -need to be in (config-if)
  -used for setting an interface's ip address, but you also need to type in the correct subnet
