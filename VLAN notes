A Trunk port is a port that can carry traffic from multiple VLANs on a single interface
  *The difference between this and access ports is that access ports require a separate interface for each VLAN

dot1q is an encapsulation method put on Ethernet frames to identify which VLAN they belong to if you are using trunk ports
  *Trunk ports = 'tagged' ports
  *access ports = 'untagged' ports

>Inter-VLAN routing review
  *If PC1 on VLAN 10 wants to reach PC2 on VLAN 30, PC1 must forward its traffic through VLAN 10 to the router, and then the router will
forward the traffic to PC2 through VLAN 30.

>In an Ethernet frame, there is the Ethernet header, the packet, and then the Ethernet trailer. 'dot1q' inserts its tag in the Ethernet header
between the source MAC address and the type/length fields of the Ethernet header.
*The tag is 4 bytes, consisting of two parts: TPID (Tag Protocol Identifier) and TCI (Tag Control Information).
  *TPID's value is always set to 0x8100, and this indicates that the frame is tagged.
  *TCI consists of 3 fields: PCP, DEI, and VID.
    *PCP (Priority Code Point) is 3 bits in length and is used for CoS (Class of Service), which prioritizes important traffic in
congested networks.
    *DEI (Drop Eligible Indicator) is a single bit in length and is used to tell if a frame can be dropped in congested networks to ensure
more important traffic can get through.
    *VID (VLAN ID) most important field and is 12 bits in length. This is used for identifying what number VLAN is being used (1-4094).
(12^2 is 4096, but the first and the last VLANS are reserved and cannot be used)

>VLAN ranges
*The range of VLANs (1-4094) is divided into two:
  *normal VLANs (1-1005) and extended VLANs (1006-4094)

>Native VLAN
*A switch will usually have a native VLAN on VLAN 1
*A native VLAN will not tag any frames, so it still follows the rules of a trunk port, but devices sending information from VLAN 1 will
have their traffic forwarded to other devices in VLAN 1.
*It is important to have switches' native VLANs match, or there could be instances where switches will drop frames because the incoming
native VLAN traffic could not match the receiving switch's native VLAN, and the switch will drop the frame since the frame is untagged
but the traffic belongs in a different native VLAN than its own so it cant do anything with the frame.

>configuring trunkports
*On a switch access the port you want as a trunkport in global config mode and type the following command: 'switchport mode trunk'
  *if the command is rejected you need to chnage the encapsulation mode from auto to dot1q using 'switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q'
and then type the first command again
*'show interfaces trunk' is a brief of the trunk ports
*For security purposes you may want to limit what VLANs are allowed on what trunk ports
  *When limiting you have access to several commands: all, none, except, WORD, add, remove; and to use them you use this format:
"switchport trunk allowed vlan 'choice of command' 'vlan number'"
*
