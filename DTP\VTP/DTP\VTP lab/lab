#Objectives
1. Configure the switchports connecting switches as trunk ports.
    Disable DTP on the ports.
    Confirm the administrative and operational mode of each interface.

2. Configure SW1 in VTP domain CCNA.
    Create VLANs 10, 20, and 30 on SW1.
    Have SW2 and SW3 added VLANs 10, 20, and 30?

3. Configure SW2 in VTP transparent mode.
    Add VLAN40 to SW2.
    Is VLAN40 added to the VLAN database of SW1/SW3?

4. Configure SW3 in VTP client mode.
    Try to configure VLAN50 on SW3.  Is it added?

5. Configure all switchports connected to hosts in the correct VLAN.
    Manually configure them as access ports.
    Is DTP still enabled on the switchports?

Packet Tracer

#Tasks Performed
1. For each interface connecting switches, I input the command "switchport mode trunk" and "switchport nonegotiate." I used "do sh ip int br" to check the statuses and switchports needed for
trunking are all "up, up"

2. I used the command "VTP domain CCNA" on SW1. On all three switches I the created the vlans by typing "vlan <vlan_id>"

3. I used "vtp mode transparent" to put SW2 into VTP transparent mode. VLAN 40 was not added to SW1 and 2's databases because it is in transparent mode.

4. I used "vtp mode client" to put SW3 into VTP client mode. VLAN 50 was not added because clients cannot modify/add/delete VLANS.

5. For each interface connected to an end host I typed "switchport mode access" and the "switchport access vlan <corresponding vlan id>." DTP is not enabled on these switchports because DTP will not try to
make trunking connections with access ports.
  *They say "static access" in Administrative mode instead of "Dynamic <desirable or auto>."
