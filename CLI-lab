##Objectives
  1. Change the hostnames of the router and switch to the appropriate names (R1, SW1)
     ##Use the 'hostname' command in global configuration mode##

  2.  Configure an unencrypted enable password of 'CCNA' on both devices

  3. Exit back to user EXEC mode and test the password

  4.  View the password in the running configuration

  5. Ensure that the current password, and all future passwords, are encrypted

  6. View the password in the running configuration

  7. Configure a more secure, encrypted enable password of 'Cisco' on both devices

  8. Exit back to user EXEC mode and then return to privileged EXEC mode.
    Which password do you have to use?

  9. View the passwords in the running configuration.
     What encryption type number is used for the encrypted 'enable password'?
     What encryption type number is used for the encrypted 'enable secret'?

  10. Save the running configuration to the startup configuration

##Topology  
              PC1
            /
  R1 - SW1 - PC2
            \
              PC3

##Lab Setup
Packet Tracer

##Tasks Performed
(1)-For task 1 I entered Router 1's CLI and used the following commands (same for switch)
  -Router>en
  -Router#conf t
  -Router(config)#hostname R1
(2)-For task 2, I entered Router 1(and switch 1)'s CLI and used the follwoing commands
  -R1>en
  -R1#conf t
  -R1(config)#enable password CCNA
(3)-For task 3 I used the exit command until I reached user exec mode and was successfully prompted with a password line to access privelleged exec mode
(4)-For task 4, I viewed the password using the following commands
  -R1>en
  -R1#show running-config
    -the output of this command shows the command I used to enable a password and the password itself, unencrypted
(5)-For task 5, I used the follwoing commands to encrypt the password
  -R1>en
  -R1#conf t
  -R1(config)#service password-encrypt
  *-R1(config)#exit
  *-R1#show running-config
    -and with this command I was able to see the password I had used encrypted
    (6)-Task 6 in thos case was completed using an additional 2 commands marked with an asterick
(7)-For task 7, I had to enable a more secure password this time, and an encryption service more secure than password-encryption is 'secret'
  -These are the commands I used
    -R1>en
    -R1#conf t
    -R1(config)#enable secret Cisco
    -R1(config)#exit
    -R1#show running-config
      -secret enabled password and regular encrypted password both shown
(8)-For task 8, the secret password was required in order to gain access to privelleged exec mode
(9)-Encryption type number 7 is used for enable password and encryption type number 5 was used for enable secret
(10)-To accomplish this task I used the follwoing commands
  -R1>en
  -R1#write
  
  



##Troubleshooting and Notes
(1)-I used the '?' command to see the available commands in exec mode, privelaged exec mode, and in global configuration mode until I found the hostname command in global configuration mode.
***NOTE- instead of exiting from global config each time just preceed your privelleged exec command while in global config with 'do'
