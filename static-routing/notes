##Definitions
-Default Gateway (Router)
  *also called default route
  *default routes are usually used to direct traffic towards the internet
  *it is a route that includes all possible ip addresses: 0.0.0.0/0
  *This is the least specific route possible
    *in routing, the router looks at its routing table and attempts to match the packets ip adderess with the most specific match it can find in its routing table
  *In order for PCs to send packets outside of their local network (across routers) they first have to send their packet to the default gateway
    -pcs learn the router's mac adderess via an ARP request

##CLI commands
-R1(config)#ip route "followed by the ip address, netmask, and then the nexthop" 
 *next-hop is just the respective interface's ip address
 *you can also replace next-hop with exit-interface or follow exit-interface with next-hop
  *exit-interface will specify what interface to send the packet out of
  *exit-interface next-hop will do both
*it i just a matter of preference for which to use

##Configuing a default route on a Cisco router
*"Gateway of last resort is not set" means the default route isnt set yet
*To configure a default route it is the same command but the ip address and the netmask should all be zeroes
and followed by next-hop to the internet
*"S*" - candidate to be default route
