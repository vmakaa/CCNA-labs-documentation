This screenshot is a chart that helps visualize how static routing works, how two way reachability is achieved, and which "hops" the the packet must make to different routers
to reach the destination.

The chart is visualizing "how do i get to the next hop and do i have a way to get back?" AKA two way reachability

Another way to look at it is "Which route or ip adderess should i take in order to get to the destination?"
