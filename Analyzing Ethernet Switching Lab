##Objectives 
  Both switches have an empty MAC address table, and all PCs have an empty ARP table.

  1. If PC1 pings to PC3, what messages will be sent over the network, 
     and which devices will receive them?

  2. Send the ping and use Packet Tracer's 'simulation mode' to verify your answer.

  3. Use pings to generate network traffic and allow the switches to learn the MAC addresses 
     of all PCs on the network.

  4. Use 'show' commands on the switches to identify the MAC address of each PC.

  5. Clear the dynamic MAC addresses from the MAC address table of each switch.

##Topology
            192.168.1.0/24

    PC1 .1           PC3 .3
      \            /
PC2 .2 -  SW1 --- SW2 - PC4 .4

##Lab Setup
Packet Tracer

##Tasks Performed
(1)First an ARP request will be broadcast to all devices on the network, then the device with the matching mac adderess will send an ARP reply to
the PC that sent the ARP request, then once the ARP reply is recieved an echo request is sent by PC1 to PC3 and PC3 sends back an echo reply.
  NOTE: in wireshark, ARP is explained like this:
    Who has IP address 192.168.1.3? Tell 192.168.1.1.
      Essentially what its doing is that its finding which mac adderess ahs that IP adderess
(2)^^^
(3)In the command prompt of each PC, I set them to ping a PC on the opposing switch (ex: PC1 -> PC3 etc.). One of the PCS still had to send
an ARP request (PC1 -> PC4) whereas the others still had the mac adderesses in their table so they skipped the ARP request and went straight
to the echo request. Due to this, it is safe to say the switches learned the PCs mac addresses.
(4)On each switch, in order to identify the mac address of each PC I used the Cisco IOS command "show mac address-table"
  NOTE: In order to use this command you must be in privelleged exec mode
  PC1's mac address is 00d0.d3ad.9cab
  PC2's mac address is 0060.5c56.14d3
  PC3's mac address is 0004.9a6e.d870
  PC4's mac address is 0001.647b.3119

##Troubleshooting and notes
Not much troubleshooting but I did play around with how short I can make the Cisco IOS command needed in this lab
Router#show mac address-table can be shortened to Router#show mac a
