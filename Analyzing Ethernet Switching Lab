##Objectives 
  Both switches have an empty MAC address table, and all PCs have an empty ARP table.

  1. If PC1 pings to PC3, what messages will be sent over the network, 
     and which devices will receive them?

  2. Send the ping and use Packet Tracer's 'simulation mode' to verify your answer.

  3. Use pings to generate network traffic and allow the switches to learn the MAC addresses 
     of all PCs on the network.

  4. Use 'show' commands on the switches to identify the MAC address of each PC.

  5. Clear the dynamic MAC addresses from the MAC address table of each switch.
