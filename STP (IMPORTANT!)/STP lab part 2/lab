#Objectives
1. Use the CLI to check the current STP topology.  What is the current root bridge?
    What is the STP role/state of each port on each switch?

2. Configure SW1 as the primary root for VLAN1 and the secondary root for VLAN2.
    Configure SW2 and the primary root for VLAN2 and the secondary root for VLAN1.
    What is the STP role/state of each port on each switch now?

3. Increase the VLAN1 cost of SW4's F0/2 interface to 100.
    Does SW4 select a different root port?  Why/why not?

4. Increase the VLAN1 port priority of SW1's F0/1 to 240.
    Does SW3 select a different root port?  Why/why not?

5. Configure PortFast and BPDU Guard on the F0/3 interfaces of SW3/SW4.

#Tasks Performed
1. SW2 is the current root bridge. On SW2 all ports are designated. On SW1 Fa0/1 is blocked and Fa0/2-3 are designated. On SW3 Fa0/1 is desg and Fa0/2 is the root port. 
On SW4 Fa0/1 is the root port, Fa0/2 is blocked, and Fa0/3 is desg. I used the command "show spanning-tree" to check all of these on each switch.

2. On each respective switch i did the command "span vlan <vlan id> root <primary or secondary>"
The STP port status now depends on the vlan. In VLAN 1 on SW1 all ports are desg however in vlan 2 on switch 1 Fa0/1-2 are down but Fa0/3 is the root port. 
In VLAN 1 on SW2 Fa0/1-2 are desg but Fa0/3 is the root port and in vlan 2 on SW2 all ports are desg.

3. To increase the cost of F0/2 on SW4 on the interface level I used the command "span vlan 1 cost 100." SW4 did choose a new root port because the new root port had a cost of 38 instead of 100.

4.To increase the port priority of F0/1 on SW1 to see if it affects SW3's root port selection I used this command on the interface level: "span vlan 1 port-priority 240." It did not affect SW3's root port
selection because root priority is the tiebreaker after root cost and the root cost to SW1 from SW3 via F0/1 is the lowest so that will stay as the root port.

5. On SW3 and SW4's CLI's I typed the commands "spanning-tree portfast" and "spanning-tree bpduguard enable" on both switches' F0/3 interface.
